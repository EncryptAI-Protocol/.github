# EncryptAI: A marketplace for Privacy Preserving AI using Zero Knowledge and Fully Homomorphic Encryption

## Overview
EncryptAI is a conceptual marketplace designed for the secure exchange of datasets and machine learning models, with a focus on privacy-preserving technologies like Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). The marketplace facilitates transactions between data providers, model developers, and end-users, leveraging NFT-based asset tokenization to secure ownership and usage rights of datasets and models.

This project explores the integration of cryptographic techniques in machine learning, presenting a potential solution for secure AI model validation and inference in a decentralized ecosystem.
