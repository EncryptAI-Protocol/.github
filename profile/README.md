# EncryptAI: A marketplace for Privacy Preserving AI using Zero Knowledge and Fully Homomorphic Encryption

## Overview
EncryptAI is a conceptual marketplace designed for the secure exchange of datasets and machine learning models, with a focus on privacy-preserving technologies like Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). The marketplace facilitates transactions between data providers, model developers, and end-users, leveraging NFT-based asset tokenization to secure ownership and usage rights of datasets and models.

This project explores the integration of cryptographic techniques in machine learning, presenting a potential solution for secure AI model validation and inference in a decentralized ecosystem. 

### Repositories Structure

To separete the content of each repositorie the following structure has been followed:

- [concrete-ml](https://github.com/EncryptAI-Protocol/concrete-ml): Public repo that is a fork from Zama's original repo. Contains the validity proof implementation along with its docker image to run inference.
- [Encrypt-zkVM](https://github.com/EncryptAI-Protocol/Encrypt-zkVM): Private repo containing the implementation of the zkVM.
- [dApp](https://github.com/EncryptAI-Protocol/dApp): Public repo with the marketplace code.
- [contracts](https://github.com/EncryptAI-Protocol/contracts/tree/main): Public repo containing all smart contracts deployed.
- [EncryptAI Whitepaper](https://github.com/EncryptAI-Protocol/.github/blob/main/EncryptAI_Whitepaper_vFinal.pdf)
